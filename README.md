## Description

I am a full-stack developer and I’m passionate about building innovative products to solve interesting problems. With my experiences as a personal trainer and a coordinator in social services, I’ve developed strong communication and leadership skills, along with a relentless work ethic. I’ve always been passionate about finding creative solutions to navigate through a problem, which inspired me to pursue software engineering. I am excited to utilize my previous experiences and my passion for problem-solving to foster my growth as a software developer.
